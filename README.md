# Immersive Evolution

Addon for Immersive Engineering

**Work in progress.**

## Goal
The goal of this addon is to make a progressive evolutionary chain of machines. 
+ You should upgrade your machines to be able to process more advanced resources.
+ Upgraded machines are faster than the previous tiers and also has a bonus in byproducts
+ Upgraded machines also consumes more power
+ To be fair, if you can't provide energy for the full time operation, the machine will void it's input
